# KellyCriterionParimutuelBetting

Parimutuel betting (from French pari mutuel, "mutual betting") is a betting system in which all bets of a particular type are placed together in a pool; taxes and the "house-take" or "vigorish" are deducted, and payoff odds are calculated by sharing the pool among all winning bets. In some countries it is known as the Tote after the totalisator, which calculates and displays bets already made.

Parimutuel betting differs from fixed-odds betting in that the final payout is not determined until the pool is closed â€“ in fixed odds betting, the payout is agreed at the time the bet is sold.

The Kelly Criterion derives optimal bet sizing in fixed odd betting where the better has an edge on the house (due to superior information on the outcome), maximising long term growth rate over short term expected value. To many this is unintuitive, as shown by a study done where people were asked to maximise outcomes when betting on a biased (60% win) coin: https://elmwealth.com/lessons-from-betting-on-a-biased-coin-cool-heads-and-cautionary-tales/

In many real-world applications, particularly in finance, the Kelly Criterion overstates the portion of the portfolio that should be invested. The reasons for this are plentiful, one of which are the diminishing returns one yields when pursuing the same trading strategy with larger investments. This is particularly true for illiquid positions where the ideal investment size is large compared to the volume traded. 

Parimutuel betting more accurately models this behaviour since marginal returns diminish with greater bet size.
